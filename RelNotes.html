<h2>Instructions</h2>

This snapshot must be installed on top of the stable version 1.7.14.
I recommend that you first install 1.7.14 into a new directory and
then apply this snapshot over it.
<p>Use the <b>-nosound</b> option when launching.<br>

<h2>Release Notes (2004-01-26)</h2>

This is the first Alpha release of the 1.8 series. In this binary snapshot
you will find a new debug build of the Doomsday Engine and jDoom.
This build is pretty much the first one that can be compiled and
run after the nix-to-HEAD merge.
<p>The game is not playable at the moment because I'm in the process
of revising and integrating the player control system. Currently it
is impossible to move the player. However, the rest of the engine
is somewhat operational, save for the sound system, which will crash
the game almost certainly if not disabled.
<p>This release is intended for you to experiment with. Please note,
however, that there are numerous bugs and rendering errors. Many of these
will not be addressed until the Beta phase begins. During the Alpha phase
I will concentrate only on adding new features. Few, if any, of the Alpha
releases will be suitable for normal gameplay.
