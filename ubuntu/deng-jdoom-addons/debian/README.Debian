This package is a compilation of several upstream data packs. These individual packs
had to be repacked, as the upstreams distributes them as a self-extracting Microsoft Windows
.exe files and .rar fules. They have been extracted, and re-zipped according to function
to enable deng to load the files and to allow Debian/Ubuntu users the ablity to enable/disable
the packs like Windows users.

Enjoy,

Jamie.
