----------------------
**** Introduction ****
----------------------

 The JDTP (JDOOM texture pack) is a community driven project that is similair to the D2RP (Doom 2 Retexture project). That project initially had a good start, but was unfortunately misguided during the course of its development, and cant realistically be rescued without a lot of attention. Thus, this project springs up in its place to repair the damage and salvage what can be salvaged. The main goal of the JDTP is to provide the community with a space to easily contribute their own works, as well as offering a steady stream of feedback from both site visitors and administrators. It will also be a lot more tightly controlled than its predescessor, in regards to both copyrights and quality control.

The name may be a misnomer however, as one of its goals is to be directly compatible with any other OpenGL, png texture supporting Doom Port.


-----------------------
**** Participation ****
-----------------------

If you are intrested in joining in, head over to http://forums.jfiles.org/ . On registering at the main forums, you will then have the ability to upload your own textures directly to the submission gallery. There are a few important rules that I will outline here:

1. Anything you submit MUST be entirely your own work. You may not submit modifications of original id textures, as this constitutes copyright infringement. Furthermore, you may not modify and upload any of the textures given in the JDTP, without the express permission of the original author (which will need to be evidenced unless I really really trust you ;) 

2. Only PNG images can be uploaded. This keeps the size down and the quality flawless, but please remember to use maximum compression, as some tools do not use it by default. Pngcrush and Pngout are both good programs to do this. A more detailed look at PNG files can be found here: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

3. Public domain textures, (while not preffered) may be submitted, as long as a link is given to the site they were obtained.

----------------------
**** Installation ****
----------------------

 The JDTP is compatible with both jDoom and ZDoomGL, and is simple to install for both ports. For jDoom, unzip the contents of the pack to the folder "data/jdoom/textures" under your main Doomsday folder. For ZDoomGL, unzip the textures to "textures/doom". There is also provision for textures in each Doom game that conflict (ie have the same name but a different appearance). For any of the specific game packs, consult this table for where to unzip them:


		   |	DoomsDay		ZDoomGL
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Doom 1		   |	doom1			doom1
		   |
Ultimate Doom	   |	doom1-ultimate		doom1 (no change)
		   |
Doom 2		   |	doom2			doom2
		   |
TNT - Evilution	   |	doom2-tnt		tnt
		   |
Plutonia	   |	doom2-plut		plut



Simply create a folder with the correct name inside the relevent texture folder and extract those game specific textures to it, eg "data/jdoom/textures/doom1-ultimate" or "textures/doom/doom1". Note that although Doomsday differentiates between the original registered Doom and the retail boxed Ultimate Doom, the patch to upgrade to Ultimate is free and you should kick yourself for not downloading it 10 years ago. Break out your original floppies and check: ftp://3darchives.in-span.net/pub/idgames/idstuff/doom/ for all the patches.
