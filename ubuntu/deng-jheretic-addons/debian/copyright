jHeretic Retexuring Project 2003 --->> Optimised and Repack by Cain
================================

Hello kids...

  Well here it is.  A result of far too much time than I care to mention.

  I'm not sure why texture packs seem to skip this part, but in case you're 
an invalid like at least half of us:  To use the textures with doomsday, 
create then extract them into this directory:

           c:\[doomsday root directory]\Data\jHeretic\Textures

=======

  While I have tried to hold true to maintain the artist's basic conceptual 
idea, I thought that the original textures looked very dated and needed some 
hefty "spicing" up.  As a result, you won't find ridiculous changes like 
finding a nude clown where a skull used to be, but you will find that the 
original basic texture has been replaced with a much more complex, intricate 
picture with a surprising amount of detail. In short, these just make things 
look an awful lot cooler.

   Another thanks goes out to "splatterworld.de" for a stone texturing base 
that helped shape roughly 20 of the 164 textures.  The only textures that 
AREN'T replaced in this pack are textures that are currently being worked 
into Models (by someone else... hint, hint) like weapons, hanging bodies 
etc.

   - Off hand, the mountain range background textures are a combination of 2 
or 3 different mountains, so don't ask me where the mountain range is 
located in real life - the answer's nowhere.

Enjoy folks.  Wanna play online sometime?  I do.  I'm obviously bored.

Seriously, please send me any questions if you have them.  Or even if you 
don't.  Later.
