++++++++++++++++++++++NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR+++++++++++++++++++++
Here it is, my first full-on releasable UI pack. It is missing the bull animations and
the classes walk-cycle animations due to time constraints - and I'm not sure I'll get around to adding them.
I hope someone does though! If there is something you'd like to change in this pack that I've created, email me
and I'll gladly provide the .psd (photoshop CS) files for you to work with.
