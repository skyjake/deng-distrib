Description: Icarus: Alien Vanguard 32 Level Megawad for Doom 2 [SP, COOP, DM]
 Icarus has 32 levels that are excellent for single and cooperative play,
 but we didn't forget the Deathmatchers of the world, either!
 .
 We've taken extra steps to make sure that every level is an exceptional
 Deathmatch level so that after you're done playing it alone, you can go
 through Icarus again and waste your buddies. Some maps have special features,
 and others reduce the level size for Deathmatch. In all cases, though,
 you'll know we had Deathmatch in mind when we made Icarus. And no more
 days of filtering through all the junky DM levels on the 'net.
