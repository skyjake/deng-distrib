<h2>Instructions</h2>

This snapshot must be installed on top of the stable version 1.7.14.
I recommend that you first install 1.7.14 into a new directory and
then apply this snapshot over it.<br>

<h2>Release Notes (2004-02-09)</h2>

This is the second Alpha release of the 1.8 series. In this binary snapshot
you will find a debug build of the Doomsday Engine and jDoom.
<p>The game is not playable at the moment because I'm in the process
of revising and integrating the player control system. Currently it
is possible to move the player, but turning is impossible.
The rest of the engine is somewhat operational.
<p>This release is intended for you to experiment with. Please note,
however, that there are numerous bugs and rendering errors. Many of these
will not be addressed until the Beta phase begins. During the Alpha phase
I will concentrate only on adding new features. Few, if any, of the Alpha
releases will be suitable for normal gameplay.
<p>See the change log for a detailed list of changes:
